            <p>
                By the time I completed high school, I felt very confident that the most exciting (and likely most lucrative) careers available
                to my cohort were in technology and computer science. Upon graduating, I had convinced myself that traditional
                college was out of my reach. I started a long slog through a number of jobs and community colleges trying
                to find something I could make my life’s work. Personally, I felt that writing code was as close to an exercise
                in creativity that one in the field of computer science could reliably be paid for, but I lacked the savvy
                to understand how to apply my talents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flashback to my middle school years; when I was first set loose on the early Internet. Largely unsupervised, I did what any
                13 year old boy would do: I found an AOL chatroom full of nerdy teenagers who wrote add-on software. Most
                of the software was largely benign. Useful in kicking other users out of chat rooms and disconnecting them
                from the internet by overloading their hardware, but little else. It was an exercise in angst; after finding
                a local friend with similar interests, I made my own add-on software using a dubious version of Visual Basic
                3.0 and began to use and distribute it in the community.
            </p>
            <p>
                As excited as tech professionals are supposed to be about the early Internet, the reality is that it was pretty boring. It
                was slow, there wasn’t much useful information, and if your mom needed the phone you had to sign off. This
                was an important confluence for me. My computer was a hand-me-down. In the era of Windows 98 SE, I was running
                Windows 3.11, so gaming on my computer was still largely done in DOS. While poking around in DOS, I discovered
                QBASIC.
            </p>
            <p>
                My functional knowledge of Visual Basic all of a sudden began to frame a new understanding. I printed out and referenced
                QBASIC documentation and was able to make my computer do incredible things by copying source code out of
                magazines. The Summer that I learned QBASIC was the spark that informed my realization at the end of high
                school.
            </p>
            <p>
                The circumstances of the time which led me away from the lucrative and exciting path of a developer seem so insignificant
                now. While my attempts at higher education and my early career in retail led me askew, the financial crash
                of 2008 finally dialed in my focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew I needed to be in tech, but lacked the skills to do so. I opted to leverage my retail skills and take a lateral jump
                into eCommerce. When I was hired by RevZilla.com, there were fewer than twenty employees. RevZilla was more
                than a blessing, it was the business education I never knew I wanted. I knew that building things was what
                I wanted to do, and RevZilla’s number one goal was to grow quickly but not as a means to attract investment.
                RevZilla was a true experiment by the founding partners to build something that would not only dominate,
                but also stand the test of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started in fulfillment operations as the receiving manager. I built procedures and documentation along side of a revolving
                cast of fulfillment center managers who were alternately fired for cause or poached to loftier positions
                at larger companies. Eventually, the directors at RevZilla noticed me as a point of consistency and helped
                me find my next challenge which was to help build a team around our order processing procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
                I built a team from scratch using largely unknown talent from within RevZilla’s own fulfillment team. The team was responsible
                for advocating for customers and their orders. The team interacted with every operations team at RevZilla.
                I developed procedures and communication structure between my team and customer service, purchasing, fulfillment,
                and most relevant to my interests, our in house software development team. In addition to the site itself,
                RevZilla.com also builds almost all admin and SCM software in house. My role was to interpret the needs of
                our business-unit users and provide relevant feedback to ensure the tools created were up to the task of
                managing my team’s day-to-day operations and to scale into the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I recognize now that I’ve skewed away from what should have been an obvious path, I’m ready to correct course. And
                I’m not even mad; I learned so much in my early career. Many of those experiences further clarified my focus,
                which is why I’ve decided to enroll in the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp. I am ready to make an acute pivot in
                my career, but take with me the useful skills I’ve already developed. I’ve already been through the start-up
                ‘bootcamp’, and now I’m poised to add some new tools to my kit and build the next big idea.
