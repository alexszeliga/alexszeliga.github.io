            I like abstractions because they allow the ability to view problems
            objectively.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
            a2+b2=c2 is not an abstraction; but it’s dependant on one: the right
            triangle. The right triangle is itself dependant on a handful of
            abstractions: lines, points, triangles, angles, geometric planes,
            numbers, values, standardized measurement etc…
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
            In computer science, we talk about the ‘towering pile of
            abstractions’, but it’s really more of a pyramid. To get better at
            solving problems, we have to get better at traversing that pyramid.
            At the top of the pyramid is the real world problem: the algorithm,
            the question, the unfinished project. Quantifying reality is a
            necessary antecedent of abstraction. If you know your problem inside
            and out, abstractions should help you get to the solution. Drawing a
            boundary around the problem will stop the pyramid from growing too
            large. Focusing in on your problem will help keep the steps between
            each layer from overwhelming the process.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
            For computer scientists, the first layer of abstraction is usually
            code; we take a problem, we turn it into code. You drink the coffee,
            you place the widget in the sidebar, you go home. Why complicate
            things? Because Skynet is active. I started in medium volume
            wholesale in the early 2000’s and I’ve been sprinting from a wave of
            obsolescence that’s been crashing down on every job I’ve managed to
            land ever since. You traverse down the pyramid because the next big
            thing might not be based on your abstraction-of-choice and you may
            need to pivot.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
            Abstractions help us in our relationships, too. Common ground can be
            much easier to find by starting with abstractions. It’s easier to
            discover one’s Girl Scout Cookie preference by asking, rather than
            by buying a box of each and watching which one they go for first;
            far be it from me to judge, though.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
            Here’s to deeper understanding, DRY semantic code, better
            relationships and (potentially) leftover Girl Scout Cookies. Hope
            you don’t like Caramel Delites.
