                    I like abstractions because they allow the ability to view problems objectively.

                <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
                    a2+b2=c2 is not an abstraction; but it’s dependant on one: the right triangle. The right triangle
                    is itself dependant on a handful of abstractions: lines, points, triangles, angles, geometric
                    planes, numbers, values, standardized measurement etc…
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
                    In computer science, we talk about the ‘towering pile of abstractions’, but it’s really more of a
                    pyramid. To get better at solving problems, we have to get better at traversing that pyramid. At
                    the top of the pyramid is the real world problem: the algorithm, the question, the unfinished
                    project. Quantifying reality is a necessary antecedent of abstraction. If you know your problem
                    inside and out, abstractions should help you get to the solution. Drawing a boundary around the
                    problem will stop the pyramid from growing too large. Focusing in on your problem will help keep
                    the steps between each layer from overwhelming the process.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
                    For computer scientists, the first layer of abstraction is usually code; we take a problem, we turn
                    it into code. You drink the coffee, you place the widget in the sidebar, you go home. Why
                    complicate things? Because Skynet is active. I started in medium volume wholesale in the early
                    2000’s and I’ve been sprinting from a wave of obsolescence that’s been crashing down on every job
                    I’ve managed to land ever since. You traverse down the pyramid because the next big thing might not
                    be based on your abstraction-of-choice and you may need to pivot.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
                    Abstractions help us in our relationships, too. Common ground can be much easier to find by
                    starting with abstractions. It’s easier to discover one’s Girl Scout Cookie preference by asking,
                    rather than by buying a box of each and watching which one they go for first; far be it from me to
                    judge, though.

                    Here’s to deeper understanding, DRY semantic code, better relationships and (potentially) leftover
                    Girl Scout Cookies. Hope you don’t like Caramel Delites.
