            By the time I completed high school, I felt very confident that the
            most exciting (and likely most lucrative) careers available to my
            cohort were in technology and computer science. Upon graduating, I
            had convinced myself that traditional college was out of my reach. I
            started a long slog through a number of jobs and community colleges
            trying to find something I could make my life’s work. Personally, I
            felt that writing code was as close to an exercise in creativity
            that one in the field of computer science could reliably be paid
            for, but I lacked the savvy to understand how to apply my talents.

            Flashback to my middle school years; when I was first set loose on
            the early Internet. Largely unsupervised, I did what any 13 year old
            boy would do: I found an AOL chatroom full of nerdy teenagers who
            wrote add-on software. Most of the software was largely benign.
            Useful in kicking other users out of chat rooms and disconnecting
            them from the internet by overloading their hardware, but little
            else. It was an exercise in angst; after finding a local friend with
            similar interests, I made my own add-on software using a dubious
            version of Visual Basic 3.0 and began to use and distribute it in
            the community.

            As excited as tech professionals are supposed to be about the early
            Internet, the reality is that it was pretty boring. It was slow,
            there wasn’t much useful information, and if your mom needed the
            phone you had to sign off. This was an important confluence for me.
            My computer was a hand-me-down. In the era of Windows 98 SE, I was
            running Windows 3.11, so gaming on my computer was still largely
            done in DOS. While poking around in DOS, I discovered QBASIC.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
            My functional knowledge of Visual Basic all of a sudden began to
            frame a new understanding. I printed out and referenced QBASIC
            documentation and was able to make my computer do incredible things
            by copying source code out of magazines. The Summer that I learned
            QBASIC was the spark that informed my realization at the end of high
            school.

            The circumstances of the time which led me away from the lucrative
            and exciting path of a developer seem so insignificant now. While my
            attempts at higher education and my early career in retail led me
            askew, the financial crash of 2008 finally dialed in my focus.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
            I knew I needed to be in tech, but lacked the skills to do so. I
            opted to leverage my retail skills and take a lateral jump into
            eCommerce. When I was hired by RevZilla.com, there were fewer than
            twenty employees. RevZilla was more than a blessing, it was the
            business education I never knew I wanted. I knew that building
            things was what I wanted to do, and RevZilla’s number one goal was
            to grow quickly but not as a means to attract investment. RevZilla
            was a true experiment by the founding partners to build something
            that would not only dominate, but also stand the test of time.

            I started in fulfillment operations as the receiving manager. I
            built procedures and documentation along side of a revolving cast of
            fulfillment center managers who were alternately fired for cause or
            poached to loftier positions at larger companies. Eventually, the
            directors at RevZilla noticed me as a point of consistency and
            helped me find my next challenge which was to help build a team
            around our order processing procedures.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph text-font">
            I built a team from scratch using largely unknown talent from within
            RevZilla’s own fulfillment team. The team was responsible for
            advocating for customers and their orders. The team interacted with
            every operations team at RevZilla. I developed procedures and
            communication structure between my team and customer service,
            purchasing, fulfillment, and most relevant to my interests, our in
            house software development team. In addition to the site itself,
            RevZilla.com also builds almost all admin and SCM software in house.
            My role was to interpret the needs of our business-unit users and
            provide relevant feedback to ensure the tools created were up to the
            task of managing my team’s day-to-day operations and to scale into
            the future.

            While I recognize now that I’ve skewed away from what should have
            been an obvious path, I’m ready to correct course. And I’m not even
            mad; I learned so much in my early career. Many of those experiences
            further clarified my focus, which is why I’ve decided to enroll in
            the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp. I am ready to make an acute pivot in
            my career, but take with me the useful skills I’ve already
            developed. I’ve already been through the start-up ‘bootcamp’, and
            now I’m poised to add some new tools to my kit and build the next
            big idea.
