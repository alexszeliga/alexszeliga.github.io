                    By the time I completed high school, I felt very confident that the most exciting (and likely most
                    lucrative) careers available
                    to my cohort were in technology and computer science. Upon graduating, I had convinced myself that
                    traditional
                    college was out of my reach. I started a long slog through a number of jobs and community colleges
                    trying
                    to find something I could make my life’s work. Personally, I felt that writing code was as close to
                    an exercise
                    in creativity that one in the field of computer science could reliably be paid for, but I lacked
                    the savvy
                    to understand how to apply my talents.

                    Flashback to my middle school years; when I was first set loose on the early Internet. Largely
                    unsupervised, I did what any
                    13 year old boy would do: I found an AOL chatroom full of nerdy teenagers who wrote add-on
                    software. Most
                    of the software was largely benign. Useful in kicking other users out of chat rooms and
                    disconnecting them
                    from the internet by overloading their hardware, but little else. It was an exercise in angst;
                    after finding
                    a local friend with similar interests, I made my own add-on software using a dubious version of
                    Visual Basic
                    3.0 and began to use and distribute it in the community.

                <p class="mb text-font">
                    As excited as tech professionals are supposed to be about the early Internet, the reality is that
                    it was pretty boring. It
                    was slow, there wasn’t much useful information, and if your mom needed the phone you had to sign
                    off. This
                    was an important confluence for me. My computer was a hand-me-down. In the era of Windows 98 SE, I
                    was running
                    Windows 3.11, so gaming on my computer was still largely done in DOS. While poking around in DOS, I
                    discovered
                    QBASIC.
                </p>
                <p class="mb text-font">
                    My functional knowledge of Visual Basic all of a sudden began to frame a new understanding. I
                    printed out and referenced
                    QBASIC documentation and was able to make my computer do incredible things by copying source code
                    out of
                    magazines. The Summer that I learned QBASIC was the spark that informed my realization at the end
                    of high
                    school.

                    The circumstances of the time which led me away from the lucrative and exciting path of a developer
                    seem so insignificant
                    now. While my attempts at higher education and my early career in retail led me askew, the
                    financial crash
                    of 2008 finally dialed in my focus.

                <p class="mb text-font">
                    I knew I needed to be in tech, but lacked the skills to do so. I opted to leverage my retail skills
                    and take a lateral jump
                    into eCommerce. When I was hired by RevZilla.com, there were fewer than twenty employees. RevZilla
                    was more
                    than a blessing, it was the business education I never knew I wanted. I knew that building things
                    was what
                    I wanted to do, and RevZilla’s number one goal was to grow quickly but not as a means to attract
                    investment.
                    RevZilla was a true experiment by the founding partners to build something that would not only
                    dominate,
                    but also stand the test of time.

                    I started in fulfillment operations as the receiving manager. I built procedures and documentation
                    along side of a revolving
                    cast of fulfillment center managers who were alternately fired for cause or poached to loftier
                    positions
                    at larger companies. Eventually, the directors at RevZilla noticed me as a point of consistency and
                    helped
                    me find my next challenge which was to help build a team around our order processing procedures.
                </p>
                <p class="mb text-font">
                    I built a team from scratch using largely unknown talent from within RevZilla’s own fulfillment
                    team. The team was responsible
                    for advocating for customers and their orders. The team interacted with every operations team at
                    RevZilla.
                    I developed procedures and communication structure between my team and customer service,
                    purchasing, fulfillment,
                    and most relevant to my interests, our in house software development team. In addition to the site
                    itself,
                    RevZilla.com also builds almost all admin and SCM software in house. My role was to interpret the
                    needs of
                    our business-unit users and provide relevant feedback to ensure the tools created were up to the
                    task of
                    managing my team’s day-to-day operations and to scale into the future.

                    While I recognize now that I’ve skewed away from what should have been an obvious path, I’m ready
                    to correct course. And
                    I’m not even mad; I learned so much in my early career. Many of those experiences further clarified
                    my focus,
                    which is why I’ve decided to enroll in the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp. I am ready to make an acute
                    pivot in
                    my career, but take with me the useful skills I’ve already developed. I’ve already been through the
                    start-up
                    ‘bootcamp’, and now I’m poised to add some new tools to my kit and build the next big idea.
